## Maze - generate, traverse, and solve mazes

### What is maze?

Maze is a 2D grid of cells. Each cell has 4 walls (top, right, bottom, left). Each wall can be either open or closed. A maze is generated by opening and closing walls between cells. A maze can be traversed by moving from cell to cell through open walls. A maze can be solved by finding a path from a start cell to an end cell.

### Model

We will use a model with the following classes:

* `MazeItem` - a point in 2D space, has x and y coordinates, can be visited or not visited, can be a wall or a cell (is a base class for `Cell` and `Wall`)
* `Cell` - a cell, always open for passage
* `Wall` - a wall, can be open or closed
* `Maze` - a maze is a 2D matrix of cells and walls, like this:
```
wall wall wall wall will
wall cell wall cell will
wall wall wall wall will
wall cell wall cell will
wall wall wall wall will
```

As we can see, in ths model the number of items (both walls and cells) in one dimension is always odd, and is equal to numberOfCells * 2 + 1.

### Generate

To generate a maze, we will use the following Python script from [this repository, containing maze generation codes in various languages](https://github.com/joewing/maze/blob/master/maze.py)

### Parse the generated maze

Generated maze should be saved to a file. See the format in `maze_sample.txt`. We will use this file to parse the maze, build a model, and solve it.

### Solve

As soon as we generated a maze, it becomes a graph. We can use graph search algorithms to find a path from start to end. We can use the following algorithms:

* [Breadth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) (BFS)
* [Depth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) (DFS)
* [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) (Dijkstra)
* [A* search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) (A*)

### TODO

* [ ] Measure distance from start and distance to end
* [ ] Is it possibe to make path search multi-threaded? How to sync the paths?
* [ ] Is it possible to make path search distributed? Again, how to sync the paths? Storing in distributed cache?
